# Aerity

We are a group of students working on our project, Large Scale Early Warning System for Deadly Environmental Elements. It is a network of pollution and radiation detectors that will feed information to our website, which is integrated with Google Maps and will show you the areas that are dangerous to visit.

This repository contains the codes for our webpage (http://ihome.ust.hk/~maresdhayana/cgi-bin/map/index_new.php), as well as the codes written to retrieve data from the sensors we use. 

Disclaimer: The codes for the website were not all written by us. We used brucenorton's code (https://github.com/ost-micromedia-brucenorton2014/jQuery-Mobile-HTML5-geolocation-API-Google-Maps-API) as the base and added the features and content we want. The Python codes for retrieving information from sensors used a function to control MCP3002, and the code for that function was taken from RasPi.TV (http://raspi.tv/2013/controlled-shutdown-duration-test-of-pi-model-a-with-2-cell-lipo).
